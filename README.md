# A Local Restaurant Touch-free Web Menu

A simple touch-free web menu for a local restaurant chain created with React.

## About The Project

Due to the Covid-19, traditional menus may not be good for every customer. 
This website is built for customers who want to prefer a touch-free menu option at the restaurant. 
Since almost everyone carries a smartphone, an online menu would be a great choice. 

This website is built with React.js
